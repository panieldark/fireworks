## Getting Started 
1. Download Files (make sure they are saved to same folder)
2. Check out p5js.org for API / documentation (code is not well documented)
3. Run index.html on your preferred web browser

## Acknowledgements/Other
This is my fork of CodingTrain's (youtube <- The Coding Train) Coding Challenge. I recommend checking his videos out!

###Takeaways from this experience
1. First sole JavaScript project (not fully intertwined with HTML/CSS or React/Angular)
2. First time using p5 library for javascript
3. Fun experience with JavaScript.. looks beautiful too
